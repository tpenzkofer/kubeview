# kubeview

A btop-style terminal dashboard for monitoring a Kubernetes (microk8s) cluster.
A multi-pane live view: cluster CPU/MEM history (braille graphs), every pod
across all namespaces with per-pod CPU sparklines, a container-detail pane, an
auto-tailed logs pane for the selected pod, and per-namespace resource meters.

## Install

kubeview is a single static binary (no runtime deps). Pick one:

**Release binary (installer):** run on the target machine:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpenzkofer/kubeview/main/install.sh | bash
# or a specific version:  ... | bash -s -- v0.1.0
```

**Debian / Ubuntu (`.deb`):** tracked by `dpkg`, so `apt remove kubeview` cleans up.

```sh
arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)                     # amd64 or arm64
tag=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/tpenzkofer/kubeview/releases/latest \
      | grep -m1 '"tag_name"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
deb="kubeview_${tag#v}_linux_${arch}.deb"
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/tpenzkofer/kubeview/releases/download/${tag}/${deb}"
sudo apt install "./${deb}"
```

An `.rpm` with the same name scheme is published for Fedora/RHEL.

**With Go (≥ the version in `go.mod`):**

```sh
go install github.com/tpenzkofer/kubeview@latest
```

**From source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tpenzkofer/kubeview && cd kubeview
make build          # ./kubeview for this host
make dist           # cross-compiled binaries in dist/ (linux/darwin × amd64/arm64)
```

### Prerequisites

A reachable kubeconfig (or in-cluster service account). On a microk8s node:

```sh
microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
microk8s enable metrics-server   # needed for the CPU/MEM meters
```

## Monitor a remote cluster over SSH

```sh
kubeview --ssh penzkoft@192.168.64.7
```

Nothing is installed on the node. kubeview reads its kubeconfig over SSH, opens
an `ssh -L` tunnel to the API server, and points client-go at it — so only port
22 has to be reachable and the API server port can stay firewalled.

**Credentials are OpenSSH's business, not kubeview's.** There is no password
flag, and nothing is stored: authentication is whatever `ssh <host>` already does
on your machine — agent keys, `~/.ssh/config` aliases, `ProxyJump` bastions,
`known_hosts` checking, passphrase and 2FA prompts. The tunnel is established
before the TUI takes the screen, so those prompts work normally.

```sh
kubeview --ssh mynode                       # a ~/.ssh/config alias
kubeview --ssh user@node --ssh-opt -J --ssh-opt bastion.corp     # via a bastion
kubeview --ssh user@node --ssh-opt -i --ssh-opt ~/.ssh/k8s_ed25519
kubeview --ssh user@node --ssh-kubeconfig-cmd 'sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml'
```

By default kubeview runs `microk8s config`, falling back to `kubectl config view
--raw` and then `~/.kube/config`; `--ssh-kubeconfig-cmd` overrides that.

Requires the `ssh` client in `PATH`. Two things still run *on the node* because
they shell out to `microk8s kubectl`: the interactive shell (`S`) opens its own
SSH session, and a port-forward (`P`) binds `0.0.0.0` **on the node**, not on
your machine. Everything else — pods, metrics, logs, env, YAML, events, delete,
restart, scale — goes through the tunnel.

## Deploy on a server

kubeview is an interactive TUI, so you run it on a machine and view it in a
terminal — it is not a background daemon. Three setups:

- **From your workstation over SSH:** `kubeview --ssh user@node` (above). Nothing
  to install on the node.
- **On the cluster node:** install the binary (above) and run it over SSH.
  It uses the node's `~/.kube/config`. This is the simplest option, and the one
  where `S` and `P` behave most naturally.
- **With an exported kubeconfig:** `scp node:~/.kube/config ./kc && kubeview
  -kubeconfig ./kc` (edit the `server:` field to the node's reachable IP). Needs
  the API server port open to you.

Before a release exists (or to run an unreleased commit), build on the node and
install it yourself — stamping the version keeps `kubeview -version` honest about
which commit is running:

```sh
rsync -a --exclude .git ./ node:~/kubeview/
ssh node 'cd ~/kubeview && go build -trimpath \
  -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" -o kubeview . \
  && sudo install -m 0755 kubeview /usr/local/bin/kubeview'
```

Note this copies the binary rather than linking it, so a later rebuild in the
source tree does not update `/usr/local/bin` — re-run the install.

Or cross-compile for the server's arch and copy it over:

```sh
make dist && scp dist/kubeview-linux-arm64 user@server:/usr/local/bin/kubeview
```

Releases (tarballs, `.deb`/`.rpm`, checksums) are produced automatically by
GitHub Actions when you push a `vX.Y.Z` tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`).

## Run

```sh
./kubeview                  # interactive btop-style TUI (all namespaces)
./kubeview --demo           # synthetic cluster, no kubeconfig needed
./kubeview -theme gruvbox   # tokyonight|gruvbox|nord|dracula|mono
./kubeview -namespace demo  # single namespace
./kubeview -interval 1s     # refresh rate
./kubeview --snapshot       # print one plain-text frame and exit (scriptable)
./kubeview --dump-frame 140x40                 # render one TUI frame to stdout (for testing)
./kubeview --dump-frame 140x40 --frame-mode net   # modes: list|net|logs|help|modal
```

### Keys

**Global**

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`…`6` | dashboard / network / events / pressure / nodes / port-forwards |
| `T` | cycle colour theme (saved) |
| `?` | help + plain-language explanations of k8s concepts |
| `r` | refresh now |
| `tab` | switch focus between the pods list and the bottom-right pane |
| `e` | switch that pane between **logs** and the container's **environment** |
| `q` | quit (saves preferences) |

**Pods list (focused)**

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` `PgUp`/`PgDn` `g`/`G` | move selection |
| `o` | cycle sort: name → cpu → mem → restarts → age → status |
| `t` | toggle tree view: namespace ▸ workload ▸ pod |
| `space` | fold/unfold the node under the cursor (tree view) |
| `n` | fold/unfold the namespace (tree view) |
| `N` | fold/unfold every namespace — the whole cluster on one screen (tree view) |
| `/` | filter by namespace/pod name |
| `S` | open an interactive shell inside the selected container (`exec -it`) |
| `i` | inspect: env, mounts, `df`, processes, `ls /` (read-only) |
| `y` | view live YAML |
| `D` | describe + recent events |
| `d` | delete pod (confirm) |
| `R` | restart workload — rollout restart for Deployments (confirm) |
| `s` | scale the Deployment behind the pod |
| `P` | port-forward the pod to this host |

**Logs pane (focused via `tab`)**

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` `PgUp`/`PgDn` `g`/`G` | scroll |
| `f` | toggle follow-tail |
| `w` | toggle line wrap |
| `p` | toggle previous-container logs (why a `CrashLoopBackOff` died) |
| `[` / `]` | switch container in a multi-container pod |
| `/` | search within the log |

**Env pane (`e` swaps it in for the logs)**

Shows the container's environment twice: what the pod spec *declares* — naming
indirect sources, so `DATABASE_URL ← secret db-creds/url` rather than a value —
and what the process actually *sees*, read with `env` inside the container. The
runtime list therefore also contains what the kubelet injected (the
`KUBERNETES_*` and `*_SERVICE_HOST` service links) and what the image's own
Dockerfile set. It needs a shell in the image; on distroless it falls back to
the declared list. Values with credential-looking names are masked.

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` `PgUp`/`PgDn` `g`/`G` | scroll |
| `m` | mask / reveal credential-looking values |
| `R` | re-read the runtime env (it is not refreshed on every tick) |
| `[` / `]` | switch container in a multi-container pod |

Destructive/outward actions (`d`, `R`, `s`, `P`) always ask for confirmation first.
The interactive shell and port-forward use the node's `microk8s kubectl`. `P` starts a
**background** port-forward (binds `0.0.0.0` on the host); manage them in the `6` view
(`x` stop selected, `X` stop all).

**Tree view** (`t`) nests pods under the workload that owns them and the
namespace that scopes them, with running totals on every node. `↑`/`↓` walk every
row, headers included, and `space` folds or unfolds whichever node the cursor is
on — a folded node keeps the selection, so the same key reopens it. `n` folds a
namespace, `N` folds them all, turning a 250-pod cluster into a one-screen
summary. Sorting applies at each level, so `o` (cpu) puts the busiest namespace
on top, then its busiest workload. Pod actions (`S i y D d R s P`) need a pod
row; on a header they refuse rather than act on some arbitrary pod beneath it.

**Views:** `5` shows per-node capacity/allocatable/requests/usage with pressure
conditions and pod-slot saturation; `4` ranks pods by memory headroom and flags
unbounded/under-requested/near-OOM pods.

**Preferences** (theme, sort, tree, namespace, interval) are saved on quit to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kubeview/config.json` and restored next launch; explicit flags override them.

## Flags

| flag | default | meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-kubeconfig` | `$KUBECONFIG` or `~/.kube/config` | kubeconfig path |
| `--ssh` | off | monitor `[user@]host` over an SSH tunnel; installs nothing there |
| `--ssh-opt` | — | extra argument passed to `ssh` (repeatable), e.g. `-J bastion` |
| `--ssh-kubeconfig-cmd` | `microk8s config` … | command run on the SSH host to print a kubeconfig |
| `-namespace` | all | limit to one namespace |
| `-interval` | `2s` | refresh interval |
| `-truecolor` | `true` | force 24-bit colour (btop-style gradients) |
| `-theme` | `tokyonight` | colour theme: `tokyonight`/`gruvbox`/`nord`/`dracula`/`mono` |
| `--snapshot` | off | print one frame and exit |

## Notes

- Without `metrics-server`, the app still runs; CPU/MEM columns show `0` and the
  header shows `[metrics-server off]`.
- Status column mirrors `kubectl get pods` (CrashLoopBackOff, Init:0/1,
  ContainerCreating, Completed, Error, Terminating, …) and is colour-coded.
- The shell (`S`), inspect (`i`) and the env pane's runtime list all need
  `pods/exec` on the kubeconfig's identity. Masking secret-looking values is
  shoulder-surfing protection, not access control — anyone who can run kubeview
  against the cluster can already read them.
